  <history-entry date='June 19, 2016'>The OHCHR document seems to be corrupted. Article 10 should not be a list. There are two headers “LIJI LYA MUCIKUMI NYI AALI”, and they start with the same sentence as the previous article. Our version attempts to repair those defects.</history-entry>

  <history-entry date='September 4, 2006'>stage 4: OHCHR identified as the source, complete XML contributed by Adobe Systems.</history-entry>
