    <para>From what I gathered from Rhonda Hartell&#x2019;s <ulink
    url="http://www.rosettaproject.org/archive/dag/ortho-1?page_view=image_view">Alphabets
    of Africa</ulink> and the documents referenced or linked to on the
    <ulink
    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagbani_language#References">Wikipedia
    article about the Dagbani language</ulink>, especially <ulink
    url="http://rogerblench.info/Ethnoscience%20data/Dagbani%20plant%20names.pdf">Dagbani
    Plant Names</ulink> or <ulink
    url="http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~olawsky/hp-dgfs.htm">Interaction
    of tone and morphology in Dagbani</ulink>, there is no evidence of
    the use of the letter X. However the letter Latin Gamma (&#x0194;
    &#x0263;) is used in some orthographies to transcribe a contextual
    allophone of g. I&#x2019;m guessing X should be replaced by as it
    was probably used as a substitute by the translator.</para>

    <para>See the word "bi&#x025B;&#x0263;u" (transcribed biEGu) in
    "Interaction of tone and morphology in Dagbani and "bi&#x025B;xu"
    in UDHR. "Dagbani Plant Names" clearly states "Most orthographies
    mark /&#x0263;/ the velar fricative as a separate consonant. This
    appears to be unnecessary as /&#x0263;/ is simply a positional
    allophone of /g/ between vowels. Nonetheless, it is marked in the
    present text as Dagbani speakers are familiar with it."  This
    agrees with Aphabets of Africa which gives &#x0263; and g for
    /&#x0263;/.</para>
