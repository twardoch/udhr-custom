<para>The document contains many occurrences of U+0027 &#x0027;
APOSTROPHE, apparently all after &#x201C;n&#x201D;. According to
<ulink url='http://www.motherlandnigeria.com/languages.html'/>,
apostrophe is not used, but &lt;n, U+0304 &#x25CC;&#x0304; COMBINING
MACRON> is; &lt;n, U+0303 &#x25CC;&#x0303; COMBINING TILDE> according
to <ulink url='http://ilc.igbonet.com/'/>; and &lt;n, U+0307
&#x25CC;&#x0307; COMBINING DOT ABOVE> according to <ulink
url='http://uwandiigbo.com/'/>. In any case, there is no combining
sequence with n in the document, so it seems that those apostrophes
should really be some combining mark on the preceding
&#x201C;n&#x201D;. </para>

<history>

  <history-entry date='September 7, 2006'>[Eric Muller] In addition to
  the problem resolved by Andrew, the document contains occurrences
  of a mark below b, h, s, t and space; the mark has been moved below
  the following vowel if there is one, removed otherwise. Also
  replaced all the occurrences of U+002D &#x002D; HYPHEN-MINUS by
  U+2010 &#x2010; HYPHEN.</history-entry>

  <history-entry date='September 7, 2006'>[Andrew Cunningham] The
  original document uses U+031F &#x25CC;&#x031F; COMBINING PLUS SIGN
  BELOW and U+031D &#x25CC;&#x031D; COMBINING UP TACK BELOW, while the
  standard orthography is to use U+0323 &#x25CC;&#x0323; COMBINING DOT
  BELOW. This has been fixed, as well are removing erroneous
  sequences of multiple combining marks (probably hidden by incomplete
  layout engines).</history-entry>
