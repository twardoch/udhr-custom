  <history-entry date='February 23, 2015'>Corrected a markup error (tag of title for article 25), thanks to Lane Schwartz.</history-entry>

  <history-entry date='November 7, 2006'>it seems that between the
  original source and the OHCHR, the data was misinterpreted along the
  way (probably from some less common 8 bit encoding to a Windows code
  page), so many &#x201C;high ASCII&#x201D; characters were
  damaged. Thanks to Arthur Reutenauer for providing a repaired
  version.</history-entry>

  <history-entry date='September 4, 2006'>stage 4: OHCHR identified as
  the source, complete XML contributed by Adobe
  Systems.</history-entry>
